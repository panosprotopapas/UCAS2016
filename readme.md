An individual project written in Stata in 2012.

The project assesses the (then) proposed change in the UK universities' admission procedure (UCAS). It does so by performing a Monte-Carlo simulation of 1000 iterations over the grades of 1000 college applicants competing to enter 20 universities. Among other things, it studies the effect the proposed change would have in:

- the number of unfilled university positions, and
- the number of envious students (loosely speaking, two students will be envious if following their assignment to a university, they'd prefer swapping assignments with each-other).

The project and its presentation achieved a score of 6.0 (the highest possible).
